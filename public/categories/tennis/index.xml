      <description>Here is the biography of me for the University of Toronto Tennis Club for 2023-2024.
Victor Zheng has served as the UofT Tennis Club’s Head of Courts (21-22), Vice President (22-23), and President (23-present).
Growing up, he was a badminton player. He never took up tennis until the age of 11, when he joined his brother at the UBC’s High-Performance Junior Tennis Training program, then coached by BC Champion Daniel Chu.</description>
