      <description>From May 2023 to December 2023, I interned at the Community Services Cluster (CSC) of GovTechON in the Government of Ontario. As my first internship experience, I thought the overall experience was excellent and it sparked my curiosity into a lot more than what I had originally signed up for. The official mission of the OPS is “taking pride in strengthening Ontario, its places and its people” and I thought this was a great chance for me to be involved in shaping the future of Ontario.</description>
