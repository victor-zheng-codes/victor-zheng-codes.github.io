      <description>In 2020, I joined Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s leading high-school hackathon organization, XdHacks Mini Vancouver.
I worked on and developed the biggest high-school hackathon event ever, and fundraised over $1,000 for the event.
Looking back, this was one of the best experiences of my life as I learned a lot about how to organize events, how to lead a team, and how to work with others. Running this hackathon showed me a lot about managing people, how people work, and how to be a leader.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed the lack of hackathons from our global rounds this past year. And you’d be right. We’ve been working hard on a new program called Hack Team 6. The mission? – train high-school students&amp;rsquo; event planning skills online, efficiently, and in a manner that is fun.
Joining XdHacks Mini in 2020, the landscape was different than today. XdHacks Mini was the only high-school hackathon organization in British Columbia (where I’m from), Zoom was still relatively new, and people were still comfortable with online events and online hackathons.</description>
