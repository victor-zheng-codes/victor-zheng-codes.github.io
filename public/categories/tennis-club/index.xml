      <description>I recently directed the 2023 U of T Tennis Club Championship from October 8th to 9th, 2023 at the University of Toronto Scarborough’s Tennis Centre. The following is my reflection on what I learned from that event and how to run a tennis tournament.
Reflection Like last year, the tournament saw 50+ players compete over 2 days to crown Club Champions.
We planned 5 sections of Men’s Singles, Men’s Doubles, Women’s Singles, Women’s Doubles, and Mixed Doubles.</description>

      <description>On October 24, 2022, I organized the Fall 2022 Skule Tennis Club (STC) vs UofT Tennis Club (UTTC) match, which resulted in a resounding victory for UTTC 11-5. Going in to the match, I had worked with Sara, STC&amp;rsquo;s President to make sure that we had everything ready to go and people to play against. I also worked with Sir Winston Churchill Park Tennis Club by booking the courts for a very low cost of $10 per member for 4 hours from 3pm-7pm.</description>
