He has served as the Lead Organizer within the Club’s many intercollegiate, internal, and community-wide events during his time on the Executive Board. At the Club, he has furthered his leadership, event-planning, organizing, and project-management skills while being integral in organizing and leading one of the Club’s biggest fundraising, membership, and event-filled years in recent memory.\nWhat does Hart House mean to you? Or alternatively, what is your favourite thing about Hart House? My favourite thing about Hart House is its community. It has an awesome history as the birthplace of ground-breaking ideas and many inspiring people. It provides the sustenance and opportunity for student leadership within the University, and in particular, the Chess Club for me. The “House,” or as I like to call it, the “Castle,” is an amazing place because of the built-in experiential learning opportunities that it provides. The different offices, departments, and people working with the same drumbeat have allowed me to feel supported and engaged with the student community, which I wouldn’t experience anywhere else on campus.\n","wordCount":"311","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://victorzheng.ca/posts/post-files/judi-schwartz/HH_awards.jpg","datePublished":"2023-05-30T22:33:16-04:00","dateModified":"2023-05-30T22:33:16-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Victor Zheng"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://victorzheng.ca/posts/winning-the-judi-schwartz-memorial-prize/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Victor Zheng","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://github.com/victor-zheng-codes/Personal-Website/blob/main/static/chess_design_favicon.png?raw=true"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/ accesskey=h title="Victor Zheng (Alt + H)">Victor Zheng</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Winning the Judi Schwartz Memorial Scholarship</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2023-05-30 22:33:16 -0400 EDT'>May 30, 2023&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;2 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;311 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Victor Zheng</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/post-files/judi-schwartz/HH_awards.jpg alt><p></p></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#award-info>Award Info</a></li><li><a href=#my-biography>My Biography</a></li><li><a href=#what-does-hart-house-mean-to-you-or-alternatively-what-is-your-favourite-thing-about-hart-house>What does Hart House mean to you?
