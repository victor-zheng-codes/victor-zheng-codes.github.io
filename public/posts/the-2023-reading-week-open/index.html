The report I wrote with all images can be found here: https://harthousechess.com/2023/02/24/nikolay-noritsyn-wins-in-strong-crown-section-at-2023-reading-week-open/.\nPlease see below for the text (no images) that I wrote for the event.\nFrom February 18th to 20th, 2023, a record-breaking 226 players spent their Family Day weekend at the Hart House Reading \u003e Week Open. The tournament was the first since the COVID-19 pandemic postponed events in 2021 and 2022 and this featured \u003e a very strong Crown section highlighted by Grandmaster Razvan Preotu and multi-time winner International Master Nikolay \u003e Noritsyn. The tournament was sold-out early, with 226 players reached 1 week prior to the registration deadline, perhaps \u003e an indication of the growth of chess during the pandemic. The tournament also boasted the largest student showing in \u003e recent memory, alongside another ~25+ unrated players playing in their first tournament.\nSimilar to the 2022 Holidays Open, the tournament used an online registration system that allowed for payments to be \u003e made prior to Round 1 and which enabled an on-time start. Registrations were accepted via in-person, telephone, online, \u003e and cheque methods, making the tournament registration system the most efficient than ever before. The tournament \u003e boasted a prize fund of $9,250 and games were solely played in the Great Hall of the “castle”, Hart House, at the \u003e University of Toronto.\nLike pre-pandemic, the tournament was divided into 6 sections based on ratings, however with a few added exceptions from \u003e pre-pandemic years. Firstly, Crown would require either 2200 CFC or a 2000 FIDE to compete and U1600 would be rated FIDE \u003e alongside the other top sections. In addition, the Club’s Executive learned how to operate DGT boards and thus operated \u003e them for the duration of the tournament to allow anyone in the world to view games live as they were played. Finally, \u003e student photographers were invited for all rounds to help document the interesting, serious, and funny moments of the \u003e tournament.\nBoard 1, Round 6 between IM Noritsyn and GM Preotu (Photo: Alayna Jang) In the Crown Section (25 players), thanks to the increased restrictions to the Crown section, a large number of strong \u003e Masters competed in the event. 1 Grandmaster, 6 International Masters, 1 Woman International Master, 4 FIDE Masters, and \u003e 4 Candidate Masters entered the field of 25. Other than Noritsyn, the other IMs were alumnus IM Mark Plotkin and IM \u003e David Cummings, current U of T student IM Nicholas Vettese, Ukrainian IM Alexander Reprintsev, and Canadian IM Eric \u003e Lawson. Former U of T Varsity Team player FM Mike Ivanov and current U of T student WIM Yunshan Li rounded out the top-9 \u003e seeds. Interestingly, UWaterloo’s Club president FM Richard Chen and UWaterloo student CM William Li also competed in \u003e the Crown section. CM Max Chen, the winner of the recent 2022 Holidays Open, was seeded 15th and went up against IM Eric \u003e Lawson in Round 1.\nFM Dukic placed 2nd with 5/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang)\nIM Noritsyn placed 1st with 5.5/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang)\nWIM Li placed tied 3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang) The rounds featured lots of very competitive chess and resulted in many very close matches alongside some surprising \u003e upsets. GM Preotu, after defeating FM Dukic in round 1, faced Kyle Morrison, who pulled off the big upset. IM Noritsyn \u003e played numerous rounds of exceptional chess, beating CM Rusonik, CM Jaferian, WIM Li, and the GM slayer Morrison to \u003e enter round 6 with 4.5/5 and in clear 1st. WIM Li, apart from the loss to IM Noritsyn, performed remarkably to enter \u003e Round 6 in clear second with 4/5 after important wins over Sergey Noritsyn (IM Noritsyn’s younger brother and U of T \u003e student), and IM Plotkin.\nFM Chen placed tied 3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang)\nGM Preotu with 3.5/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang)\nIM Plotkin placed 3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang) GM Preotu did, however, recover from his loss, to enter Round 6 in a massive tie for 3rd and which set himself up for a \u003e 1-vs-2 clash in Round 6 featuring GM Preotu vs IM Noritsyn. IM Noritsyn, with white, played absolutely brilliant chess \u003e yet again and came out on top with the win and the $1500 first place prize. His 5.5/6 result earned him a performance \u003e rating of 2687 – GM level stuff! With WIM Li’s loss to FM Dukic, Dukic came out clear 2nd with 4.5/5. A 5 way tie for \u003e 3rd was split between IM Plotkin, IM Cummings, WIM Li, FM Chen, and CM Jaferian.\nCM Jaferian placed tied 3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Victoria Lee)\nIM Cummings placed tied-3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Victoria Lee)\nIM Plotkin vs Sergey Noritsyn and FM Chen vs IM Lawson. Rd 6 (Photo: Alayna Jang) The Under 2200 Section (38 players) was also stronger than usual thanks to the play-up rules, resulting in a large \u003e number of 2100s competing for the $700 first place prize. Matthew Shih and Eddie Xu came out on top after Shih pulled \u003e off a gutsy win over fellow U of T Varsity Team player Wenzhi Dai in Round 6 on board 1 while Xu pulled off the victory \u003e over alumnus Leon Perelman. U of T students and alumni were notable in the section, with Shih, Dai, Perelman, Cindy \u003e Qiao, and Ethan Moon in the top-8 all having some affiliation as a student.\nRound 6 U2200 board 1 and 2, Shih vs Dai and Perelman vs Xu (Photo: Alayna Jang)\nRound 6 U1900 board 1, Wang vs Melnychuk In the Under 1900 Section Hart House Chess Club members Denys Melnychuk and Yixiao (Isabelle) Wang had undefeated starts \u003e before their matchup in Round 6. Isabelle sat at 5/5 and undefeated in all her rated CFC-games going into her match \u003e against Denys (4.5/5), where she would suffer her first ever CFC-rated defeat. Notably, the only unrated player in the \u003e section, U of T student Chol Elijah Akol started out strong, however, tapered off at the end. Another notable result was \u003e that Halldor P. Palsson and Omar Shar, notable chess organizers, competed and placed top-7. Denys Melnychuk (5.5/6) \u003e would finish 1st, Isabelle Wang, Halldor Palsson, and Saarthak Malakar tied for 2nd-4th with 5/6.\nIn the Under 1600 Section (38 players), Anthony Pham finished 5.5/6 for clear first, followed closely by a 3-way tie for \u003e 2nd-4th between Michael Ashcroft, Andrew Leliveld, and U of T student Payam Fakoorziba at 4.5/6. U of T student Daniel \u003e Wang and HHCC member Anna Gavrileva tied for 5th at 4/6.\nRound 6 U1600 Board 1, Anthony Pham vs Kailey Liu\nGood game! (Photo: Alayna Jang) In the Under 1300 Section (50 players), Jerry Gerber started off 5/5 before losing to overall winner Oscar Liu (5.5/6) \u003e in the final round. Gerber tied for 2nd with Andrew Sithu and Isabelle Guan. A large number of women and 12 unrated \u003e players played in this section.\nFinally, in the Under 1000 Section (27 players), another large showing of 12 unrated players made up almost 50% of the \u003e field! Perhaps this was a result of increased chess attention thanks to recent successes of chess online and in the \u003e media. Gabriel Saimovici was the overall winner with 5/6, Evan Xi and Dennis Shen split 2nd-3rd at 4.5/6.\nRound 6 U1000 board 1 between Ethan Jia and Gabriel Saimovici (Photo: Alayna Jang)\nRound 6 U1300 top boards with Jerry Gerber, Zeyu Liu (Photo: Alayna Jang) This year, the Team Prize was contested again, consisting of 4 players representing at least 3 different sections. The \u003e total score of each player was added together to form the cumulative team score. 17 teams of 4 entered their names and \u003e after 5 rounds, only 2 teams remained in contention. Tied at 17 points apiece going into Round 6 were the teams \u003e consisting of WIM Yunshan Li, Wenzhi Dai, Cindy Qiao, and Yixiao (Isabelle) Wang alongside the eventually winning team \u003e consisting of IM Nikolay Noritsyn, Leon Perelman, Matthew Shih, and Denys Melnychuk. Perhaps the best team showing in \u003e history, Noritsyn (5.5/6 in Crown), Shih (5/6 in U2200), and Melnychuk (5.5/6 in U1900) finished in first place in their \u003e respective sections. Combined with Perelman’s 4/6 in U2200, the team won a total of 20 out of 24 possible team points!\nLeon Perelman, team prize.

Surprisingly, this is the first time that the Reading Week Open has utilized DGT live broadcasting technology.\nHart House Chess Club would like to express its thanks to certain individuals for their work in making this event \u003e possible. Time and again, Alex Ferreira, the former student, advisor, mentor, Tournament Director, and Chief Arbiter has \u003e propelled the Reading Week Open through it all since the late 2000s. His hard work, motivation, and dedication to chess \u003e are celebrated in Canadian chess. The Club would also like to congratulate Alex on his well-deserved FIDE Arbiter title \u003e which should be soon approved this year.\nAlex Ferreira, Tournament Director (Photo: Michael Hsu)\nTanner McNamara, President (Photo: Bowen Zhang) We would like to thank the work of the Hart House Chess Club’s Executive Board, led by President and Secretary Tanner \u003e McNamara. Tanner has been at U of T and has been a part of the Executive for over 5 years, and is soon to finish his \u003e PHD. His long hours volunteering and organizing this event and the Executive do not go unnoticed. We would also like to \u003e thank Crystal Cao, the Club’s Treasurer for making the finances operate as smooth as possible while still balancing \u003e schoolwork, lab work, research work, teaching assistant work, and much more. Next, a big thank you goes to Ahmed Khalf, \u003e a second-year CS student who dedicated time designing posters, helping with set-up and take-down, all of which are \u003e immeasurable. Thank you to Bowen Zhang for playing the important role of taking up scores and taking photos for select \u003e rounds. And also a thank-you goes to Ande Li, a high-school student who volunteered his weekend helping with recording \u003e results and setting up/cleaning up. Finally, the lead organizer, Victor Zheng played an important role in responding to \u003e emails, interacting with Hart House staff, creating event webpages, creating event flyers, updating registration lists, \u003e coordinating room designs, organizing volunteers for photography, coordinating DGT boards, and setting-up/taking down \u003e DGT and chess sets.\nIn addition to these volunteers, we would like to thank the Hart House staff for their continued and dedicated support \u003e of our chess events and tournaments. The Hart House Information Hub with Jamie, Mauro, Naesha, Andrew, and student staff \u003e provided important registration assistance throughout the entire lead-up of the event. The Meetings and Events office \u003e with Madeline and Meghan, as well as the Communications Department with Cayce, Accounting Office with Stan, and Staging \u003e Personnel provided a coordinated effort to make this tournament a success. We wish to acknowledge their assistance.\nLet the games begin! Round 2 at the Reading Week Open! (Photo: Victoria Lee) The Club would like to express its gratitude to the Annex Chess Club and its team of organizers for lending chess sets \u003e and clocks to enable us to host the first-ever Reading Week Open with chess sets and equipment for all.\nA huge shoutout goes to Victoria College’s VicXposure camera club and it’s student photographers who contributed to the \u003e largest chess photo album in Hart House chess recent memory. All rounds except Round 5 were covered by a student \u003e photographer, providing both an opportunity and testing ground for students, and the resulting amazing photos. As \u003e customary, we were able to take individual, high-quality photos of almost every player and important matchup. Those \u003e photos are linked at the bottom of this post.\nI see you! (Photo: Michael Hsu) Finally, the most-important and deserved “thank-you” goes to the 226 participants who came out during Family Day Weekend \u003e to play in the tournament, and the friends, family, supporters, and chess enthusiasts who came out to the tournament as \u003e spectators. It is with your support that the Club’s initiatives and vibrancy as a hub for chess has continued for over \u003e 127 years. We are very thankful for your participation and look forward to welcoming you back to Hart House for our many \u003e upcoming events later this year.

WIM Li, apart from the loss to IM Noritsyn, performed remarkably to enter > Round 6 in clear second with 4/5 after important wins over Sergey Noritsyn (IM Noritsyn’s younger brother and U of T > student), and IM Plotkin.</p><p>FM Chen placed tied 3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang)</p><p>GM Preotu with 3.5/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang)</p><p>IM Plotkin placed 3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Alayna Jang)
GM Preotu did, however, recover from his loss, to enter Round 6 in a massive tie for 3rd and which set himself up for a > 1-vs-2 clash in Round 6 featuring GM Preotu vs IM Noritsyn. IM Noritsyn, with white, played absolutely brilliant chess > yet again and came out on top with the win and the $1500 first place prize. His 5.5/6 result earned him a performance > rating of 2687 – GM level stuff! With WIM Li’s loss to FM Dukic, Dukic came out clear 2nd with 4.5/5. A 5 way tie for > 3rd was split between IM Plotkin, IM Cummings, WIM Li, FM Chen, and CM Jaferian.</p><p>CM Jaferian placed tied 3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Victoria Lee)</p><p>IM Cummings placed tied-3rd with 4/6 (Photo: Victoria Lee)</p><p>IM Plotkin vs Sergey Noritsyn and FM Chen vs IM Lawson.

The Under 2200 Section (38 players) was also stronger than usual thanks to the play-up rules, resulting in a large > number of 2100s competing for the $700 first place prize. Matthew Shih and Eddie Xu came out on top after Shih pulled > off a gutsy win over fellow U of T Varsity Team player Wenzhi Dai in Round 6 on board 1 while Xu pulled off the victory > over alumnus Leon Perelman. U of T students and alumni were notable in the section, with Shih, Dai, Perelman, Cindy > Qiao, and Ethan Moon in the top-8 all having some affiliation as a student.</p><p>Round 6 U2200 board 1 and 2, Shih vs Dai and Perelman vs Xu (Photo: Alayna Jang)</p><p>Round 6 U1900 board 1, Wang vs Melnychuk
In the Under 1900 Section Hart House Chess Club members Denys Melnychuk and Yixiao (Isabelle) Wang had undefeated starts > before their matchup in Round 6. Isabelle sat at 5/5 and undefeated in all her rated CFC-games going into her match > against Denys (4.5/5), where she would suffer her first ever CFC-rated defeat. Notably, the only unrated player in the > section, U of T student Chol Elijah Akol started out strong, however, tapered off at the end. Another notable result was > that Halldor P. Palsson and Omar Shar, notable chess organizers, competed and placed top-7. Denys Melnychuk (5.5/6) > would finish 1st, Isabelle Wang, Halldor Palsson, and Saarthak Malakar tied for 2nd-4th with 5/6.</p><p>In the Under 1600 Section (38 players), Anthony Pham finished 5.5/6 for clear first, followed closely by a 3-way tie for > 2nd-4th between Michael Ashcroft, Andrew Leliveld, and U of T student Payam Fakoorziba at 4.5/6. U of T student Daniel > Wang and HHCC member Anna Gavrileva tied for 5th at 4/6.</p><p>Round 6 U1600 Board 1, Anthony Pham vs Kailey Liu</p><p>Good game! (Photo: Alayna Jang)
In the Under 1300 Section (50 players), Jerry Gerber started off 5/5 before losing to overall winner Oscar Liu (5.5/6) > in the final round. Gerber tied for 2nd with Andrew Sithu and Isabelle Guan. A large number of women and 12 unrated > players played in this section.</p><p>Finally, in the Under 1000 Section (27 players), another large showing of 12 unrated players made up almost 50% of the > field! Perhaps this was a result of increased chess attention thanks to recent successes of chess online and in the > media. Gabriel Saimovici was the overall winner with 5/6, Evan Xi and Dennis Shen split 2nd-3rd at 4.5/6.</p><p>Round 6 U1000 board 1 between Ethan Jia and Gabriel Saimovici (Photo: Alayna Jang)</p><p>Round 6 U1300 top boards with Jerry Gerber, Zeyu Liu (Photo: Alayna Jang)
This year, the Team Prize was contested again, consisting of 4 players representing at least 3 different sections. The > total score of each player was added together to form the cumulative team score. 17 teams of 4 entered their names and > after 5 rounds, only 2 teams remained in contention. Tied at 17 points apiece going into Round 6 were the teams > consisting of WIM Yunshan Li, Wenzhi Dai, Cindy Qiao, and Yixiao (Isabelle) Wang alongside the eventually winning team > consisting of IM Nikolay Noritsyn, Leon Perelman, Matthew Shih, and Denys Melnychuk. Perhaps the best team showing in > history, Noritsyn (5.5/6 in Crown), Shih (5/6 in U2200), and Melnychuk (5.5/6 in U1900) finished in first place in their > respective sections. Combined with Perelman’s 4/6 in U2200, the team won a total of 20 out of 24 possible team points!</p><p>Leon Perelman, team prize.
