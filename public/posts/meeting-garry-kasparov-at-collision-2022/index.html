It said something along the lines of how they needed chess sets for an important chess event happening in Downtown Toronto that afternoon, and that we were one of the only Clubs in Toronto that they thought would be able to help. I quickly responded by saying that we’re not open and that we don’t usually offer chess equipment for such a last minute request. I asked for a bit more information and informed the rest of our Execs about the situation. Unbeknownst to me at first was that this was the one and only Garry Kasparov who was coming to town.\nSoon after we realized what was at stake, and I abandoned my original plans for the day to promise Collision 2022 organizers that I would bring down some of our finest chess boards to the event. In exchange, I’d get to meet Garry Kasparov and get some of our chess boards signed.\nWithin 2 hours, I was at Hart House and getting our chess equipment to Enercare Centre and to one of the largest tech conferences in North America.\nWhen you wake up one day, you don’t expect to lug a ton of equipment to meet Garry Kasparov! When I arrived at the convention centre, I handled our equipment with care. Making sure to assign a security guard to watch over our equipment and also scouting the area for what was to come. One of the signs stated: “The Return of the King’s Gambit: Is the chess grandmaster unbeatable?”. This was quite the sight and I realized that this was really going to happen.\n“Is the chess grandmaster unbeatable?” - I guess we’d soon find out! I soon found myself walking around the centre to check out the exhibits and the interesting events happening. They had given me a full pass to the event and the ability to check out the cool technology startups and projects.\nCollision conference main stage I watched some tech talks on the Collision main stage - some were definitely interesting, others less so. I also managed to snag a few free things :).\nHere I was on the side as Garry took a minute to speak to the crowd Kasparov was in Toronto to promote one of his cryptography companies and had in fact given a keynote address earlier in the morning. He was back to play some chess!\nThe games begin! Before long, the simultaneous exhibition began and I was invited to play. Looking around, I saw that Kasparov had played a different opening for all his games, showing just how capable he was as an opponent. The crowd grew humongous, and everyone was taking photos of Kasparov. I was somewhat famous.\nI played a full match against Kasparov Everyone played black, so I didn’t have a choice on openings. Kasparov opened with 1. D4 and I went after a Queen’s gambit declined. This turned out to be the wrong thing, since I was completely out of theory after move 6.\nI was on the big screen! Lots of media and lots of people paid attention to our game. The game progressed quickly from there, with him winning an exchange in the middle game, before slowly pushing his advantage to the endgame. He ended with a quite comfortable endgame up the exchange, and with a very nice knight fork to win the game. I don’t remember the full game, but I remember that I didn’t feel too sad losing to Kasparov.\nThe organizers asked me a few questions and also gave a shoutout to the Hart House Chess Club. They said something along the lines of “Victor saved the day!\" When my game ended, the organizers asked me to go up on the stage and face the 200+ audience and live-stream. I was then asked about my game with Kasparov and how I felt I played. I was also given the opportunity to shout out my own Club and the organizers thanked me again for helping save the day.\nThe signed Kasparov boards Kasparov’s signature was both fascinating and also difficult to read at first. He really has a beautiful signature.\nAfterwards, I got the all important selfie After the event, I headed back to Hart House to return all of our sets and equipment. I took one last photo holding one of the signed Kasparov boards.\nKasparov signed 15 chess boards for the Club. I brought them back to Hart House so that we could store them for future use. Joining the Hart House Chess Club, I wouldn’t have ever dreamed of this happening. I think this is just an example of being in places in the right time. Hard work makes it easier to be lucky.\nCollision 2022, one of the biggest technology conferences in the world Taking a photo on one of the side stages (this huge stage was empty) ","wordCount":"833","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://victorzheng.ca/posts/post-files/Garry-Kasparov/Garry%20Kasparov.jpg","datePublished":"2022-06-24T00:14:13-08:00","dateModified":"2022-06-24T00:14:13-08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Victor Zheng"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://victorzheng.ca/posts/meeting-garry-kasparov-at-collision-2022/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Victor Zheng","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://github.com/victor-zheng-codes/Personal-Website/blob/main/static/chess_design_favicon.png?raw=true"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/ accesskey=h title="Victor Zheng (Alt + H)">Victor Zheng</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Meeting Garry Kasparov at Collision 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-06-24 00:14:13 -0800 -0800'>June 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;833 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Victor Zheng&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/victor-zheng-codes/Personal-Website/tree/main/content/posts/meeting-garry-kasparov-at-collision-2022.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/post-files/Garry-Kasparov/Garry%20Kasparov.jpg alt="I met World Champion Garry Kasparov at Collision 2022"><p>Meeting World Champion Garry Kaspaorv was a dream come true</p></figure><div class=post-content><p>On the morning of June 21st, 2022, I woke up to a text message to our Club&rsquo;s account from a random stranger.
