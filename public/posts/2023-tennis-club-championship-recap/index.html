The following is my reflection on what I learned from that event and how to run a tennis tournament.\nReflection Like last year, the tournament saw 50+ players compete over 2 days to crown Club Champions.\nWe planned 5 sections of Men’s Singles, Men’s Doubles, Women’s Singles, Women’s Doubles, and Mixed Doubles.\nUnlike last year, however, we had begun using an online registration system called Zeffy. This allowed the Organizing team to keep track of registrations early and without having to deal with e-transfers or cash payments. This platform has quite literally transformed our Club (more below).\nThe tournament was a 2-day event, with Men’s Singles Round of 32 and 16 played on the Saturday, and Quarters to Finals played on Day 2. In addition, we had mixed in all Doubles play on the second day along with Women’s Singles.\nAll went well on Day 1, we had great weather, good play, and a great time. Games started on time, balls bounced nicely (we used Dunlop Extra Duty instead of Penn), and we had plenty of snacks, gifts, and drinks.\nHowever, as Day 1 rounded up we looked at the weather and saw ominous news ahead. There was a 60% chance of rain throughout the day. This was bad news. On the ride home from Scarborough, a group of players and organizers chatted about what we could do. We came up with a few options: (1) we could make a gamble and hope that no rain would come, (2) we could cancel the entire event, or (3) we could run it indoors. With time ticking and not much time, I knew we needed to act quickly. I decided that before deciding on options 1 and 2, I should give a call to Eglinton Flats Winter Tennis Club. Lucky for us, they had just opened for the season and indeed had spots available for the following day on 5 courts for 6 hours. We ended up committing on the spot and running the rest of the tournament at Eglinton Flats.\nDay 2 began with no major format changes, just a newly released scheduled. We didn’t run consolation brackets and instead focused on crowing Club champions before the indoor facility closed. At the end of the Sunday evening, just before 11 pm we watched as Koji defeated Zach in a tight match to become our Club’s champion.\nKoji Iwata (Men’s winner) competes at Eglinton Flats What I Learned Here are some other notes on what I learned.\nOnline Payment Systems Help a Lot When people register for an event, they want to be greeted by an easy-to-use system to register. When they must go through multiple emails, send e-transfers, or pay by cash, less people are enthusiastic about registering. Ever since our test-run of Zeffy the previous year for our indoor tennis sessions, we’ve had very few complaints with the hundreds of transactions completed.\nBe prepared to act decisively When in the car heading home from Scarborough and thinking about the weather for tomorrow, we needed to assess and decide quickly what the best course of action was. Without hesitation, the first thing to do was to cross off items which would allow us to make an easier decision. Without calling Eglinton Flats, we wouldn’t have known whether the option even existed. Therefore, I learned to act quickly on things that are in front of us. Whenever we make a decision, make sure you have all the facts and the variables assessed.\nHitting a shot at U of T Scarborough’s tennis centre Experience Playing If You Organize When you play in the event you organize, you understand what it’s like to be on the other side. Of course, this is making sure that you have someone covering your position and not making subjective calls. Given the right scenario, playing in the event you help organize allows you to see a different angle to the tournament and think about ways to improve the event. The problem is that when you are playing in your own event, you must make sure that your focus is 100% on the you’re playing. This is a very tough thing to do and in fact likely impossible to do fully. I lost my match but gained new perspectives on how to organize a better tennis event.\nPrioritize What’s Important The most important thing on Day 2 was to finish the tournament and crown Champions. In that regard, I decided to cancel consolation matches knowing that the more important matches for first-second-third should go ahead of that. I knew that some players would be disappointed but even more players would be disappointed if we ended the week without winners.\nFind People Who Know What They Are Doing When I look for volunteers and people to help run events, we need people who know what their role is. If they are the photographer, do not expect anything less. If they are volunteering for a specific function, let them do it. It is important for volunteers that they know what responsibilities they have and not expect them to do more than what you designated. If they do exceed what was requested, then talk with them more about their goals after the event.\nAn Event Planning Does Not End Until the Event is Over When an event is going on, quick decisions must continue. Even the best planning does not prepare you for every scenario. We can only plan for so many things before it is wasting time and effort which can be better spent elsewhere. When we are focused on a project, let us plan enough so that we have options and do not waste too much time on administrative debt. Let’s sharpen our tools but also expect to use them.\nFrom indoor session at Eglinton Flats Winter Tennis Club ","wordCount":"994","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://victorzheng.ca/posts/post-files/2023-2024-club-championship-tennis/outdoors-tennis.jpg","datePublished":"2023-11-01T23:06:13-04:00","dateModified":"2023-11-01T23:06:13-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Victor Zheng"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://victorzheng.ca/posts/2023-tennis-club-championship-recap/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Victor Zheng","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://github.com/victor-zheng-codes/Personal-Website/blob/main/static/chess_design_favicon.png?raw=true"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/ accesskey=h title="Victor Zheng (Alt + H)">Victor Zheng</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://victorzheng.ca/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>2023 Tennis Club Championship Recap</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2023-11-01 23:06:13 -0400 EDT'>November 1, 2023&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;5 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;994 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Victor Zheng</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://victorzheng.ca/posts/post-files/2023-2024-club-championship-tennis/outdoors-tennis.jpg alt="Competing at the 2023-2024 U of T Tennis Club championship"><p>Competing at the 2023-2024 U of T Tennis Club championship</p></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#reflection>Reflection</a></li><li><a href=#what-i-learned>What I Learned</a><ul><li><a href=#online-payment-systems-help-a-lot>Online Payment Systems Help a Lot</a></li><li><a href=#be-prepared-to-act-decisively>Be prepared to act decisively</a></li><li><a href=#experience-playing-if-you-organize>Experience Playing If You Organize</a></li><li><a href=#prioritize-whats-important>Prioritize What’s Important</a></li><li><a href=#find-people-who-know-what-they-are-doing>Find People Who Know What They Are Doing</a></li><li><a href=#an-event-planning-does-not-end-until-the-event-is-over>An Event Planning Does Not End Until the Event is Over</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>I recently directed the 2023 U of T Tennis Club Championship from October 8th to 9th, 2023 at the University of Toronto Scarborough’s Tennis Centre.
