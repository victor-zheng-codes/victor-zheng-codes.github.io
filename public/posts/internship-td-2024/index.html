Here are my thoughts on my experience and what I learned.\nThere is a lot that I have learned, and I have tried to list some of the major items below.\nAll thoughts are my own and I have redacted any personal information and team information. The main goal for all my blogs is to provide a personal reflection of different years of my life.\nTrust I learned that the mindset of TD and around banking in general is centered around trust. Banks are in the trust business over innovation. While I was there, people focused on building systems that are trustworthy, last long, and can be developed over time.\nPeople care about designing systems that are not going to fail and are going to work for decades to come.\nThe ‘Trust’ business is also the reason there are a lot of people at the bank doing smaller scoped roles. There were many more people doing many smaller things. When I went to the cafeteria, it was filled to the brim with people.\nEach bank has its own main food court where most of their employees go to eat. Having smaller scoped responsibilities means that there is less chance of important things going wrong. It is important for any bank to have employees, not being a single source of failure.\nIt is crazy to think about how big and massive the enterprise is. I think the main TD office towers house at least 10k people who work there every workday. There are four massive TD towers (Centre, North, East, West) plus a few scattered major offices for other teams. In addition, TD also was building a modern technology center that had been promoted extensively (TD Terrace).\nInnovation Even though the focus while I was there was heavily centered around trust, there was, an entire week called “Innovation Week.” The bank still wants employees to work on innovative solutions. There was a dedicated TD team called TD Innovation with some coop students focused on the future of banking. I thought it was like RBC’s Amplify program or other similar programs. While there, the bank was in the initial stages of Artificial Intelligence adoption and was promoting some of the new AI tools which were being launched.\nDevelopment I was also a part of an Agile development team. Timelines were quick, there were daily scrums, and there was a PI Planning happening every four months. PI Planning, aka Program Increment Planning is a method of project planning which discusses a team’s upcoming goals and how they will achieve it.\nYou outline your timelines and what the different teams will be doing to achieve these goals. Instead of a Project Management office there are Executives and Platform leads alongside the technical leads who will discuss and plan for the upcoming Program increment. In each program increment there were 6 sprints in which teams would complete their goals.\nI also learned about the importance of templates. There are some 5th generation templates being used and in fact automation and QA is considered one of the areas where a lot of innovation and resources are being invested into. Automation for QA efforts are catching up to the innovation put into products years ago.\nNext Evolution of Work While there, TD was adapting a strategy called the Next Evolution of Work (NEW), which had also been advertised extensively publicly. It is a shift towards Scaled Agile and a way of developing projects more effectively. The adoption of NEW was evident throughout and was the topic of many discussions.\nNEW also involved rethinking the enterprise design of how TD works and creating “Practices” for different divisions such as Software Engineering, Quality Engineering, and other similar areas. I was under Quality Engineering practice working in automation projects.\nPractice groups would have practice leads and then would be assigned to different Platforms. These platforms would have assigned agile Pods which involved several different practices depending on need. Each Platform would have practice leads who would assign their practice members to different pods. This was a remarkably interesting concept and design which I thought was very intuitive. Instead of having people working at different capacities and teams sometimes falling behind, the entire team will be working towards the goal. Finally, each Platform supported one Journey which is a specific customer-centric goal.\nOne journey is for instance Homeownership. Anything along that Homeownership journey involves multiple platforms. Most platforms are part of multiple journeys. However, the whole idea is that teams are now thinking about the customer first and what the customer is looking for rather than having team disputes and waiting for something that may not be customer centric. Combined with Behavior Driven Development, this means that agile development both in technical and non-technical teams can happen.\nTeammates at TD Quality Engineering I was part of a Quality Engineering team within the Unsecured Consumer Credit (UCC) group. The UCC group within the Credit Platform and the Credit Platform Quality Engineering practice has a few hundred employees. For Credits itself, it was I think about 200 quality engineers. The main teams were UI teams, API teams, and mainframe teams. I found it unique that there were some teams who focus solely on testing APIs and ensuring they are configured correctly.\nMy team led Credit Card decisioning for a FICO decisioning model. FICO is the leading company for providing decisioning for credit and credit scores. The FICO score itself is universally accepted in Canada and globally. My team oversaw MBNA and Amazon’s credit decisioning.\nMy main tasks revolved around the two main automation frameworks used at TD. While there, I worked on migrating from one automation framework to the other newer one. I also helped increase return-on-investment by developing scripts that ran with high robustness and frequency. I automated a large part of the system focusing on main workflows and logged bugs for the testing framework. I worked with the TD Centre for Testing Excellence team to assess and solve issues with our migration. Overall, my automation enhancements helped us migrate to over 80% coverage from 10%.\nIntern Program The first thing that I realized when I joined is that there is quite a bit more financial backing for software systems than at my previous internship at the Government of Ontario.\nBudgets are higher and there are many more benefits than my previous internships. For instance, there was a coffee machine available and many diverse types of drinks. Teams also often had free food available for the entire floor to indulge in.\nThere was a lot of effort put in by TD into the intern program. There was a sole HR team available to support and help the interns. The program team was called the Early Talent Team. They organized weekly events, knowledge transfers, ran special programs, and were available to support all students. I participated in the TD Innovation Challenge which saw teams of 5 students work on a solution over a week and present it. There were also VR events solely for students and I got to take home a Meta Quest 2 headset.\nTD also has a cloud center with resources to support employees regarding how to use cloud products and learn cloud basics. I thought the cloud program was very cool and signed up for both my Azure Fundamentals and Azure Data Fundamentals courses which I was able to take and pass at a discounted rate.\nFinal Thoughts My four months flew by, especially with the number of events that the HR team hosted. I learned that banks are slow for a reason with many teams working on many small features. As a student intern, it makes it hard to see the big picture of what you are doing. As my internship went on though, I did begin to appreciate the overall mindset, culture, and big picture. Looking back, I do think that the big picture is one of the hardest things to understand, especially at a large organization.\nOverall, I had a wonderful time at TD during my four months and left with a lot learned and a lot of great memories.\nVictor at TD ","wordCount":"1376","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post-files/internships/TD-interns-2024-winter.jpeg","datePublished":"2024-08-01T18:21:20-04:00","dateModified":"2024-08-01T18:21:20-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Victor Zheng"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/internship-td-2024/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Victor Zheng","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://github.com/victor-zheng-codes/Personal-Website/blob/main/static/chess_design_favicon.png?raw=true"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Victor Zheng (Alt + H)">Victor Zheng</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Internship at the Toronto Dominion Bank Jan 2024 - April 2024</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2024-08-01 18:21:20 -0400 EDT'>August 1, 2024&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;7 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;1376 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Victor Zheng&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/victor-zheng-codes/Personal-Website/tree/main/content/posts/internship-td-2024.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=http://localhost:1313/posts/post-files/internships/TD-interns-2024-winter.jpeg alt><p></p></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#trust>Trust</a></li><li><a href=#innovation>Innovation</a></li><li><a href=#development>Development</a></li><li><a href=#next-evolution-of-work>Next Evolution of Work</a></li><li><a href=#quality-engineering>Quality Engineering</a></li><li><a href=#intern-program>Intern Program</a></li><li><a href=#final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=reflection-on-my-internship-at-td>Reflection on my internship at TD<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reflection-on-my-internship-at-td>#</a></h1><p>I recently interned at TD Bank, one of the leading banks in Canada.
