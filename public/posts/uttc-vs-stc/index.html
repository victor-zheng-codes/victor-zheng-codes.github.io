I also worked with Sir Winston Churchill Park Tennis Club by booking the courts for a very low cost of $10 per member for 4 hours from 3pm-7pm. Considering how there was a wait list of 1000+ people at their Club, I thought this was an awesome deal.\nThe match was held at beautiful courts out at Sir Winston Churchill Park Tennis Club. Originally, I had envisioned the tournament to run with a pre-defined schedule of 45 minutes with players pre-assigned matches. However, STC had two late drop-outs, resulting in only 8 players while we had 10. This meant that our plan needed to change, and we ended up pairing on the spot for the rest of the tournament.\nPlayers compete as the sun sets on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Our best players were Mau and Jerry, both ironically engineers. Mau is a visiting student for only this semester as he’s on an engineering exchange program. He was last in South Korea and is originally from Mexico.\nWe had our best players at the tournament! Our Club members came out strong, winning most of the singles matches, and giving tough fights in the doubles matches. The result was a close match heading into the final round. Our Club members all took one break during the match to balance the difference in players. The final matches consisted of great rallies and sportsmanship as we had a lot of team spirit and energy.\nThe team that competed consisted of players who had done well at the 2022 Club Championship. When the matches were over, the pizza arrived and the medals were handed out to our members. Congrats to the team consisting of: Wenda, Arya, Takeshi, Tony, Mau, Jerry, Cayce, Linda, and Bang!\nArya, also one of our Executives, competed for the Club. We also had some great photos taken by Takeshi (and myself) throughout the tournament.\nHere I was hitting a serve into the court against a pretty strong opponent. I also was able to participate in this tournament and git a few shots in. I thought this match went pretty smoothly and is a memory that is worth cherishing. Thank you for Sir Winston Churchill Park and Skule Tennis Club for collaborating on this awesome event.
