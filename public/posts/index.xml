      <description>I recently was asked this question and I thought I would document what I believe is the definition of Effective Leadership.
Here are my thoughts on leadership: The definition of leadership varies by team To me, leadership is very much team dependent. There is no one book that will be able to explain the specifics of every single team&amp;rsquo;s dynamic and which can be applied to every single team. We all come from different perspectives, have different motivations, and the organizations themselves are different.</description>

      <description>This past March, I did not run for the role of President of the University of Toronto Tennis Club (UTTC).
Being the President of the Club was something that I cherished and I believe that the work that I and the people I worked in will be looked upon fondly for future generations to come.
As the President of the Club, I wrote an outgoing End-Of-Year Statement to the Membership. This letter can be found at the bottom of the page.</description>

      <description>I think I have had one of the most interesting years of my life working on automation and testing. I think I have gained a ton of knowledge which I have written about below.
My experience with automation is based off a year of experience building automation tools in both Java and C# and using different frameworks and features which are used throughout the industry for both test automation and automation of deploying / configuring code.</description>

      <description>I recently directed the 2023 U of T Tennis Club Championship from October 8th to 9th, 2023 at the University of Toronto Scarborough’s Tennis Centre. The following is my reflection on what I learned from that event and how to run a tennis tournament.

We planned 5 sections of Men’s Singles, Men’s Doubles, Women’s Singles, Women’s Doubles, and Mixed Doubles.</description>

      <description>On February 26th, the cumulation of over a year of planning resulted in the first ever Canadian University Tennis Club Championship at the University of Waterloo. This is my report from organizing and directing the event.
Firstly, for context, I am the President of the University of Toronto Tennis Club, a Club with 145 paid members and an overall impact of ~800 students annually. This was one of my dreams ever since joining the Club and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy to be writing this post on the successful event that it was.</description>

      <guid>https://victorzheng.ca/posts/why-i-skipped-grade-12/</guid>
      <description>Over two years ago, back in 2020, I decided to &amp;ldquo;skip&amp;rdquo; grade 12. Here were the reasons that I listed back then (Mar. 2021), unchanged from the moment I wrote them.
The Reasons You get an extra year of your life working or learning compared to a regular student. Benefits your wealth, your experiences, etc. COVID should be gone by fall, but who knows what will happen next year? You boost your morale because it seems like you accomplished something great or made yourself special You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to prom, grad photo-ops with some people you hardly know Universities may like your application more since you graduated early.</description>

      <description>I was honoured earlier this year to have the opportunity to attend and write the official event report from the Hart House Chess Club&amp;rsquo;s PanAmerican Intercollegiate Chess Tournament in Seattle, Washington. As a player in the tournament and the lead organizer for the team&amp;rsquo;s trip, it was as no-brainer for me to also write the event report. The report can be accessed here: https://harthousechess.com/2023/01/22/uoft-makes-a-splash-at-the-2023-panamerican-intercollegiate-chess-championship/.

      <description>The Hart House Holidays Open hosted by the historic Hart House Chess Club (HHCC) returned for the first time since the pandemic. This holiday season tradition had been sidelined since Dec. 2019 thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gathering restrictions stemmed from it. I had the privilege (or responsibility as a HHCC Exec) of joining the tournament organizing team as one of the lead organizers for the event.

      <description>In 2020, I joined Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s leading high-school hackathon organization, XdHacks Mini Vancouver.
I worked on and developed the biggest high-school hackathon event ever, and fundraised over $1,000 for the event.
Looking back, this was one of the best experiences of my life as I learned a lot about how to organize events, how to lead a team, and how to work with others. Running this hackathon showed me a lot about managing people, how people work, and how to be a leader.</description>

Going in to the match, I had worked with Sara, STC&amp;rsquo;s President to make sure that we had everything ready to go and people to play against. I also worked with Sir Winston Churchill Park Tennis Club by booking the courts for a very low cost of $10 per member for 4 hours from 3pm-7pm.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed the lack of hackathons from our global rounds this past year. And you’d be right. We’ve been working hard on a new program called Hack Team 6. The mission? – train high-school students&amp;rsquo; event planning skills online, efficiently, and in a manner that is fun.
Joining XdHacks Mini in 2020, the landscape was different than today. XdHacks Mini was the only high-school hackathon organization in British Columbia (where I’m from), Zoom was still relatively new, and people were still comfortable with online events and online hackathons.</description>

      <description>On the morning of June 21st, 2022, I woke up to a text message to our Club&amp;rsquo;s account from a random stranger. It said something along the lines of how they needed chess sets for an important chess event happening in Downtown Toronto that afternoon, and that we were one of the only Clubs in Toronto that they thought would be able to help. I quickly responded by saying that we&amp;rsquo;re not open and that we don&amp;rsquo;t usually offer chess equipment for such a last minute request.</description>
