      <description>You may have noticed the lack of hackathons from our global rounds this past year. And you’d be right. We’ve been working hard on a new program called Hack Team 6. The mission? – train high-school students&amp;rsquo; event planning skills online, efficiently, and in a manner that is fun.
Joining XdHacks Mini in 2020, the landscape was different than today. XdHacks Mini was the only high-school hackathon organization in British Columbia (where I’m from), Zoom was still relatively new, and people were still comfortable with online events and online hackathons.</description>
