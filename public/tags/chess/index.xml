      <description>I had the honour of writing the Event Report for the 2023 Hart House Reading Week Open Chess Tournament during Family Day Long Weekend 2023. As the lead organizer of the event, it was a great to see such an exciting event take place and for us to pull off an excellent quality event.

      <description>I was honoured earlier this year to have the opportunity to attend and write the official event report from the Hart House Chess Club&amp;rsquo;s PanAmerican Intercollegiate Chess Tournament in Seattle, Washington. As a player in the tournament and the lead organizer for the team&amp;rsquo;s trip, it was as no-brainer for me to also write the event report. The report can be accessed here: https://harthousechess.com/2023/01/22/uoft-makes-a-splash-at-the-2023-panamerican-intercollegiate-chess-championship/.

      <description>The Hart House Holidays Open hosted by the historic Hart House Chess Club (HHCC) returned for the first time since the pandemic. This holiday season tradition had been sidelined since Dec. 2019 thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gathering restrictions stemmed from it. I had the privilege (or responsibility as a HHCC Exec) of joining the tournament organizing team as one of the lead organizers for the event.
The Event Recap 212 participants descended on the Great Hall of Hart House at the University of Toronto from Dec.</description>

      <description>On the morning of June 21st, 2022, I woke up to a text message to our Club&amp;rsquo;s account from a random stranger. It said something along the lines of how they needed chess sets for an important chess event happening in Downtown Toronto that afternoon, and that we were one of the only Clubs in Toronto that they thought would be able to help. I quickly responded by saying that we&amp;rsquo;re not open and that we don&amp;rsquo;t usually offer chess equipment for such a last minute request.</description>
