      <description>Over two years ago, back in 2020, I decided to &amp;ldquo;skip&amp;rdquo; grade 12. Here were the reasons that I listed back then (Mar. 2021), unchanged from the moment I wrote them.
The Reasons You get an extra year of your life working or learning compared to a regular student. Benefits your wealth, your experiences, etc. COVID should be gone by fall, but who knows what will happen next year? You boost your morale because it seems like you accomplished something great or made yourself special You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to prom, grad photo-ops with some people you hardly know Universities may like your application more since you graduated early.</description>
