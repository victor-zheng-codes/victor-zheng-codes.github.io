      <description>The Hart House Holidays Open hosted by the historic Hart House Chess Club (HHCC) returned for the first time since the pandemic. This holiday season tradition had been sidelined since Dec. 2019 thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gathering restrictions stemmed from it. I had the privilege (or responsibility as a HHCC Exec) of joining the tournament organizing team as one of the lead organizers for the event.
The Event Recap 212 participants descended on the Great Hall of Hart House at the University of Toronto from Dec.</description>

      <description>In 2020, I joined Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s leading high-school hackathon organization, XdHacks Mini Vancouver.
I worked on and developed the biggest high-school hackathon event ever, and fundraised over $1,000 for the event.
Looking back, this was one of the best experiences of my life as I learned a lot about how to organize events, how to lead a team, and how to work with others. Running this hackathon showed me a lot about managing people, how people work, and how to be a leader.</description>

      <description>On October 24, 2022, I organized the Fall 2022 Skule Tennis Club (STC) vs UofT Tennis Club (UTTC) match, which resulted in a resounding victory for UTTC 11-5. Going in to the match, I had worked with Sara, STC&amp;rsquo;s President to make sure that we had everything ready to go and people to play against. I also worked with Sir Winston Churchill Park Tennis Club by booking the courts for a very low cost of $10 per member for 4 hours from 3pm-7pm.</description>

      <title>Why We Started Hack Team 6</title>

      <description>You may have noticed the lack of hackathons from our global rounds this past year. And you’d be right. We’ve been working hard on a new program called Hack Team 6. The mission? – train high-school students&amp;rsquo; event planning skills online, efficiently, and in a manner that is fun.
Joining XdHacks Mini in 2020, the landscape was different than today. XdHacks Mini was the only high-school hackathon organization in British Columbia (where I’m from), Zoom was still relatively new, and people were still comfortable with online events and online hackathons.</description>
