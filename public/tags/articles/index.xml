      <description>The following page was written by Cecil Rosner, one of the only chess columnists currently still writing articles as of 2023. Rosner&amp;rsquo;s pieces are published weekly on The Globe and Mail here.
I was featured by Rosner in a piece titled &amp;ldquo;Canadaâ€™s biggest college chess club still going strong after 127 years &amp;ldquo; on Janruary 8, 2023. I did the interview with Bowen Zhang, at that time the Fundraising Director for the Hart House Chess Club.</description>
