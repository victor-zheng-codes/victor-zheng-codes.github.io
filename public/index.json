Winning Teams Team Just Aaron Aaron Zhou Pocket Park mobilizes residents to clean up trash by encouraging users to help their community's local parks by going and picking up litter. The web app is based around each user's personal virtual park, which is linked to a real, local park. A points system encourages residents to clean up trash, putting it apart from government-based and volunteering initiatives. The points system works when users go to the real world park to pick up trash and points are earned for the time spent at each park. Learn More!
