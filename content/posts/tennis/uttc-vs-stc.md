On October 24, 2022, I organized the Fall 2022 Skule Tennis Club (STC) vs UofT Tennis Club (UTTC) match, which resulted in a resounding victory for UTTC 11-5. Going in to the match, I had worked with Sara, STC's President to make sure that we had everything ready to go and people to play against. I also worked with Sir Winston Churchill Park Tennis Club by booking the courts for a very low cost of $10 per member for 4 hours from 3pm-7pm. Considering how there was a wait list of 1000+ people at their Club, I thought this was an awesome deal.

Originally, I had envisioned the tournament to run with a pre-defined schedule of 45 minutes with players pre-assigned matches. However, STC had two late drop-outs, resulting in only 8 players while we had 10. This meant that our plan needed to change, and we ended up pairing on the spot for the rest of the tournament.

Our best players were Mau and Jerry, both ironically engineers. Mau is a visiting student for only this semester as he's on an engineering exchange program. He was last in South Korea and is originally from Mexico.

| <b>We had our best players at the tournament!</b>|

Our Club members came out strong, winning most of the singles matches, and giving tough fights in the doubles matches. The result was a close match heading into the final round. Our Club members all took one break during the match to balance the difference in players. The final matches consisted of great rallies and sportsmanship as we had a lot of team spirit and energy.

When the matches were over, the pizza arrived and the medals were handed out to our members. Congrats to the team consisting of: Wenda, Arya, Takeshi, Tony, Mau, Jerry, Cayce, Linda, and Bang!

I also was able to participate in this tournament and git a few shots in. I thought this match went pretty smoothly and is a memory that is worth cherishing. Thank you for Sir Winston Churchill Park and Skule Tennis Club for collaborating on this awesome event.
