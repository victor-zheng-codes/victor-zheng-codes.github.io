I recently won the Judi Schwartz Memorial Scholarship for student leadership for my work at the Hart House Chess Club. Below is some information on the award and the content shared by Hart House.

## My Biography

Victor Zheng (he/him) is a second-year undergrad in the Computer Science Specialist program who has been a part of the Hart House Chess Club since his first year. He has served as the Lead Organizer within the Club’s many intercollegiate, internal, and community-wide events during his time on the Executive Board. At the Club, he has furthered his leadership, event-planning, organizing, and project-management skills while being integral in organizing and leading one of the Club’s biggest fundraising, membership, and event-filled years in recent memory.

## What does Hart House mean to you? Or alternatively, what is your favourite thing about Hart House? 

My favourite thing about Hart House is its community. It has an awesome history as the birthplace of ground-breaking ideas and many inspiring people. It provides the sustenance and opportunity for student leadership within the University, and in particular, the Chess Club for me. The “House,” or as I like to call it, the “Castle,” is an amazing place because of the built-in experiential learning opportunities that it provides. The different offices, departments, and people working with the same drumbeat have allowed me to feel supported and engaged with the student community, which I wouldn’t experience anywhere else on campus.
