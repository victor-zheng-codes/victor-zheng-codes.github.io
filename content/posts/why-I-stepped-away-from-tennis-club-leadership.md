This past March, I did not run for the role of President of the University of Toronto Tennis Club (UTTC). 

Being the President of the Club was something that I cherished and I believe that the work that I and the people I worked in will be looked upon fondly for future generations to come. 

As the President of the Club, I wrote an outgoing End-Of-Year Statement to the Membership. This letter can be found at the bottom of the page. I also have a few personal thoughts that I didn't write which I've included below. 

When I first joined the Club in 2021, we were a stalling club with little impact other than a few events a year. I believed at the very beginning that we could bring weekly play to U of T and make tennis an accessible sport for the thousands of students at U of T. I had dreams and aspirations for immediate changes and areas where I thought we could make a difference. I believe we achieved our goals and even pushed the boundaries of what was possible. 

Three years later, I believe those goals that I set out were achieved and those goals that I weren't able to achieve will be carried forward by a new generation of leaders at the Club. Last year, we eclipsed 200 members for the first time in our history, an increase of 1000% percent from the year I joined (20 to 200). We made year-round, weekly tennis for all levels the standard, and received the highest funding allocations in our Club's history. We created partnerships with local tennis clubs, other university entities, and extended connections to University clubs across Ontario. We created a culture which we had never seen and a program developed thanks to hundreds of hours of volunteer work from dozens of people.

At the end of the day, the work that we do can't go on forever. Leaders can't keep leading a ship without admitting that the direction may not be the right one. We need breaks and new ideas to sail our ship to Paris instead of New York. We need new blood to inspire our crew, recruit new members, and bring new efficiency gains and ideas to the spotlight. As I sailed the ship, I questioned whether we were sailing in the right direction, whether we had the right crew, and whether we had the right resources to get `there`. And once we got `there` I didn't know and still don't know what counts as the finish line. There's always going to be projects we can do embark to improve the club, same as there will be for every organization in the world. Therefore, I thought it's appropriate to give way to new ideas and new leadership. I am a believer in giving opportunities for everyone to gain knowledge, explore their passions, and develop into better humans. Nobody's born a leader, we need to be given the opportunities to succeed. I believe that our new leadership team, although new, with the right supports, will succeed. 

This upcoming year, UTTC will be led by Koji, Aditya, and Ezra. I will be helping in more of an advisatory role. This will be an exciting year and I hope everyone joins me in cheering them on. 

Finally, I would like to thank the many Executives who I've worked with over the past few years. In particular, Angel Sun, Adimchi Atisele, Josh Grief, Takeshi Yamaguchi, Christina Lin, Khang Nguyen, Hymn Ka, Aditya Rao and many more who have been part of the leadership of the Club and who we wouldn't have done it without.

> TO: 		2023-2024 UTTC Members 

> FROM:	Victor Zheng, President

> DATE: 	April 11th, 2024

> SUBJECT:	End-of-Year Statement from The President

> Dear UTTC Club Members,

> Yesterday, we learned of the results of the University of Toronto Tennis Club 2024-2025 elections. As the outgoing President of this club, this is my final letter to our membership. 

> When I joined our club in 2021, we had 20 members, and we have grown substantially to over 190 today. Our social media platforms have grown; we’ve revamped our Instagram and Discord platforms and developed a new website. 

> Our teams have worked hard to build community, create connections, and deliver experiences that you will remember fondly. We tried our best, and I believe we have created a better tennis community at the University of Toronto. Delivering a lasting partnership with Eglinton Flats Winter Tennis Club has driven our success, and the year-round tennis that our Club offers is the structure that we have always needed. 

> Today, on behalf of all members, I would like to congratulate the incoming Executive Team as they take on the challenging yet rewarding task of moving our Club forward. In particular, I would like to congratulate Koji Iwata, who will serve as our next President. I chatted with Koji last week and am confident that under his leadership, the Club will develop into an even greater community. 

> Stepping aside is something I have not taken lightly. However, in all great organizations, all leaders must look toward the next generation. We are in great hands. I will take on our Communications portfolio this upcoming year in a more mentorship role within the Club. I know that I'll forever cherish what we have built together. I hope that you all stay a part of UTTC and continue to contribute to our Tennis Club. 

> Thank you for being a member. 

> Best wishes,

> Victor Zheng

> President
