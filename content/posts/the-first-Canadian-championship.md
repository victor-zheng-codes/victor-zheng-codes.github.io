On February 26th, the cumulation of over a year of planning resulted in the first ever Canadian University Tennis Club Championship at the University of Waterloo. This is my report from organizing and directing the event. 

Firstly, for context, I am the President of the University of Toronto Tennis Club, a Club with 145 paid members and an overall impact of ~800 students annually. This was one of my dreams ever since joining the Club and I'm really happy to be writing this post on the successful event that it was.

Entering University of Toronto in 2021, I really didn't know what I wanted to do. However, I knew that I loved two things: chess and tennis. Therefore, I decided that it'd be smart to join the two Clubs on campus that represented these two activities. However, I realized soon after joining both Clubs that there was something missing. And instead of complaining to others and thinking about what could be, I decided that I could use my skills to create the change that I wished to see. 

Because of a lack of weekly tennis offered by the UofT Tennis Club (UTTC), I applied for the role of Court Coordinator. What I found was that nobody wanted the role and so I was essentially immediately promoted to Director of Courts / Head of Courts. In my first year at the Club, I focused on running outdoor tennis at Ramsden Park and then thereafter at Cedarvale Park. These involved heading out on scheduled "practice" days and presiding over group tennis. However, turnout was always between 3 - 10 people, nothing ever big nor special. And soon thereafter, an early snowfall season and cold forced us to stop operating our weekly outdoor practices. As the Head of Courts in just my 2nd month of University, I didn't have any experience with coordinating booking nor signing contracts for indoor courts. Therefore, our Vice-President was in charge of this and contacted a bunch of indoor facilities in November, to no avail. We then went into the new year with a month-long pandemic induced break (UofT was closed) and I really felt that our Club wasn't doing anything. That's when I decided to take it into my own hands.

As an aside: UofT's main campus, UTSG, doesn't have their own indoor tennis facilities other than at a multi-purpose gym that allows for drop-ins and intramurals in the mornings which get booked instantly. UTSC in Scarborough has an outdoor, state of the art, purpose built, tennis facility, but that's a 1.5 hr bus ride from the UTSG campus. 

I decided to send emails to Tennis Canada, UofT's Athletics Centre, and local indoor tennis clubs asking about indoor tennis opportunities and partnership opportunities. I compiled documents on all the approximately 7 local indoor tennis centres and the contacts of their managers. I also compiled contacts for various university clubs across Ontario in the hopes that I could learn from them and what they did in their University Tennis Clubs. In my communication with these other universities, I offered to collaborate with them in the future on events to revive the University tennis landscape in Canada. That's also when we heard back from Eglinton Flats Winter Tennis Club. 

Flash forward 1 year later, and I'm now the President of the Club and we're off to Waterloo! The event was held this year in Waterloo because it was the closest of the three participating clubs: Western, Waterloo, and UofT (us). 

We had booked courts at Greystone Racquet Club, a recently opened, state of the art, 6-court facility next to the Waterloo campus. The nice thing about this tennis tournament was that we didn't have to organize anything until relatively last minute. The format was basically set, and the main problem was attracting enough people to go.

Essentially, our Executive sent out a form to our members asking who wanted to play for our Club. There was a lot of interest in the men's side, so I used a variety of factors to select a team based on performances at the UofT Tennis Club championship and commitment to the Club's indoor/outdoor tennis season. Perhaps we could've ran a selection tournament, but we really didn't have many indoor courts available just to do that. Our partnership with Eglinton Flats allowed us to use group rate indoor tennis bookings for our members on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings, but I opened bookings early for all members so a selection tournament wasn't really feasible. The women's side was the trickiest as we had to recruit 4 women, and we only had about 5 interested in going. Hymn, one of the Director of Courts, helped me reach out to the people she knew, and we finally assembled our team. 

I ordered a trophy from a local shop and Takeshi helped pick it up for me. He also would serve as our official photographer (credit to him for the photos). Then, we were off. In our budget, we originally didn't have money for a car rental, but learning about how unconvenient it would be, we decided to allow that to be added as a miscellaneous cost. Wenda and Khang would be our drivers, and we headed out bright and early. We arrived at 11:40 am, and we got everyone onto the courts practicing.

As part of our plans between the Presidents, the 12pm - 1pm period would involve the Captain's meeting and debrief on the logistics of the event. I had made sure to bring enough boys that I didn't have to compete and I could help coach/watch our players. This allowed me to serve as the Team Captain and also Tournament Director.

Our bookings were on 4 courts for 6 hours. With 3 Clubs/Universities involved, scheduling was an issue. We didn't really have an estimate on how long the games would take, so we decided to create a scheduled round robin and then see how it would look afterwards. The below photo was the schedule of the matches. We had originally planned to use 5 courts, but we only had 4, so the last mixed doubles round would go at the end.

| <b> The original match schedule</b>|


The format of the games were originally planned as pro-sets and up to 1 hr. However, I wasn't a huge fan of this because it would mean a lot of sitting around and few games for our boys side while a lot of games for our girls side. For context, we had brought 6 boys and 4 girls, with the agreed minimum of 4 each plus alternates. Thus, I argued for a single set and then we would decide after the round robin on additional matches. 

Eventually, we started at 1 pm and games were very quick surprisingly. Khang and I went to grab takeout nearby, and sets were already done within 20 minutes. Thus, we had to race back to count scores and calculate next players. I thought it'd take 40 ish minutes, but that was an overestimate. Thus, eventually, by 3pm, we had already finished our original schedule. So we began another round of the same schedule. The end result was 27 matches, 9 18 matches each per school, with 9 against each other. There would only be time for 3 mixed doubles matches. 



The format worked out because we had an even amount of games played by each school. And it also allowed for an exciting finish. At some point, Western pulled out to a 4 or 5 point lead against all of the schools, but then, suddenly, Waterloo started winning. They turned the tables and won a lot at the end. Our team at UofT, won most of the singles matches. At the very end, I got schooled by someone at Waterloo about using Excel for counting the scores. Thus, my scorekeeping was a bit awkward and I had to make new formulas for counting the scores. Finally, the end result was a TIE! Western and Waterloo scored 10 points each, and UofT 7. The tiebreaker was games won. Western edged out Waterloo by a score of 81 - 74.

Overall, the event was a really great success and I hope that we have all agreed to continue to work on running this event next year again! I would like to congratulate the other organizers, Harry Lin (Western President) and Andre Sprenger (Waterloo President) for coming onboard this journey and making the event happen.

As a freshman entering UofT in 2021, I never thought that I would be in the position I am today, as the leader and representative of over 145 members of the University of Toronto Tennis Club. I point to a lot of hard work, dedication, and commitment as the reasons for where I am today in this role. As we begin our 2023 election cycle, I urge all candidates to join our Executive and make the change that you wish to see.
