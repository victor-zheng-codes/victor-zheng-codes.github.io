Good leadership depends on the team. Every relationship between every person is different and getting to know how their personalities work is the key to good leadership. Good leadership is about communicating with everyone transparently, and making sure that there are always clear lines of communication. Team members should feel comfortable speaking to you about concerns and you should be able to emotionally be there to support others. It's important to remember that folks are human, make mistakes, and have many amazing, exciting, and sometimes depressing things happening in their lives. Overall, I think the most important skill of a leader is listening skills and the ability to not only listen but empathize and put themself in another person's shoes.


I hope to learn how other leaders motivate themselves to wake up everyday and do what they do. I hope to learn how other students handle stressful situations and how they persevere through challenges. I want to learn about how other students and other leaders handle innovation and how they apply it to the places they lead. I'd like to learn about listening strategies and how to listen better. Finally, I'd like to learn about how leaders incorporate "fun" into leadership and the relationship they have with managing that with the pursuit of the Club members' goals.
