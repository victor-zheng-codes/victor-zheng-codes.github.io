I had the honour of writing the Event Report for the 2023 Hart House Reading Week Open Chess Tournament during Family Day Long Weekend 2023. As the lead organizer of the event, it was a great to see such an exciting event take place and for us to pull off an excellent quality event. The report I wrote with all images can be found here: [https://harthousechess.com/2023/02/24/nikolay-noritsyn-wins-in-strong-crown-section-at-2023-reading-week-open/](https://harthousechess.com/2023/02/24/nikolay-noritsyn-wins-in-strong-crown-section-at-2023-reading-week-open/). 

-----------------------------
**Please see below for the text (no images) that I wrote for the event.**


> From February 18th to 20th, 2023, a record-breaking 226 players spent their Family Day weekend at the Hart House Reading > Week Open. The tournament was the first since the COVID-19 pandemic postponed events in 2021 and 2022 and this featured > a very strong Crown section highlighted by Grandmaster Razvan Preotu and multi-time winner International Master Nikolay > Noritsyn. The tournament was sold-out early, with 226 players reached 1 week prior to the registration deadline, perhaps > an indication of the growth of chess during the pandemic. The tournament also boasted the largest student showing in > recent memory, alongside another ~25+ unrated players playing in their first tournament.
> 
> Similar to the 2022 Holidays Open, the tournament used an online registration system that allowed for payments to be > made prior to Round 1 and which enabled an on-time start. Registrations were accepted via in-person, telephone, online, > and cheque methods, making the tournament registration system the most efficient than ever before. The tournament > boasted a prize fund of $9,250 and games were solely played in the Great Hall of the “castle”, Hart House, at the > University of Toronto.
> 
> Like pre-pandemic, the tournament was divided into 6 sections based on ratings, however with a few added exceptions from > pre-pandemic years. Firstly, Crown would require either 2200 CFC or a 2000 FIDE to compete and U1600 would be rated FIDE > alongside the other top sections. In addition, the Club’s Executive learned how to operate DGT boards and thus operated > them for the duration of the tournament to allow anyone in the world to view games live as they were played. Finally, > student photographers were invited for all rounds to help document the interesting, serious, and funny moments of the > tournament.

> In the Crown Section (25 players), thanks to the increased restrictions to the Crown section, a large number of strong > Masters competed in the event. 1 Grandmaster, 6 International Masters, 1 Woman International Master, 4 FIDE Masters, and > 4 Candidate Masters entered the field of 25. Other than Noritsyn, the other IMs were alumnus IM Mark Plotkin and IM > David Cummings, current U of T student IM Nicholas Vettese, Ukrainian IM Alexander Reprintsev, and Canadian IM Eric > Lawson. Former U of T Varsity Team player FM Mike Ivanov and current U of T student WIM Yunshan Li rounded out the top-9 > seeds. Interestingly, UWaterloo’s Club president FM Richard Chen and UWaterloo student CM William Li also competed in > the Crown section. CM Max Chen, the winner of the recent 2022 Holidays Open, was seeded 15th and went up against IM Eric > Lawson in Round 1.

> The rounds featured lots of very competitive chess and resulted in many very close matches alongside some surprising > upsets. GM Preotu, after defeating FM Dukic in round 1, faced Kyle Morrison, who pulled off the big upset. IM Noritsyn > played numerous rounds of exceptional chess, beating CM Rusonik, CM Jaferian, WIM Li, and the GM slayer Morrison to > enter round 6 with 4.5/5 and in clear 1st. WIM Li, apart from the loss to IM Noritsyn, performed remarkably to enter > Round 6 in clear second with 4/5 after important wins over Sergey Noritsyn (IM Noritsyn’s younger brother and U of T > student), and IM Plotkin.

> GM Preotu did, however, recover from his loss, to enter Round 6 in a massive tie for 3rd and which set himself up for a > 1-vs-2 clash in Round 6 featuring GM Preotu vs IM Noritsyn. IM Noritsyn, with white, played absolutely brilliant chess > yet again and came out on top with the win and the $1500 first place prize. His 5.5/6 result earned him a performance > rating of 2687 – GM level stuff! With WIM Li’s loss to FM Dukic, Dukic came out clear 2nd with 4.5/5. A 5 way tie for > 3rd was split between IM Plotkin, IM Cummings, WIM Li, FM Chen, and CM Jaferian.

> The Under 2200 Section (38 players) was also stronger than usual thanks to the play-up rules, resulting in a large > number of 2100s competing for the $700 first place prize. Matthew Shih and Eddie Xu came out on top after Shih pulled > off a gutsy win over fellow U of T Varsity Team player Wenzhi Dai in Round 6 on board 1 while Xu pulled off the victory > over alumnus Leon Perelman. U of T students and alumni were notable in the section, with Shih, Dai, Perelman, Cindy > Qiao, and Ethan Moon in the top-8 all having some affiliation as a student.

> Round 6 U1900 board 1, Wang vs Melnychuk
> In the Under 1900 Section Hart House Chess Club members Denys Melnychuk and Yixiao (Isabelle) Wang had undefeated starts > before their matchup in Round 6. Isabelle sat at 5/5 and undefeated in all her rated CFC-games going into her match > against Denys (4.5/5), where she would suffer her first ever CFC-rated defeat. Notably, the only unrated player in the > section, U of T student Chol Elijah Akol started out strong, however, tapered off at the end. Another notable result was > that Halldor P. Palsson and Omar Shar, notable chess organizers, competed and placed top-7. Denys Melnychuk (5.5/6) > would finish 1st, Isabelle Wang, Halldor Palsson, and Saarthak Malakar tied for 2nd-4th with 5/6.
> 
> In the Under 1600 Section (38 players), Anthony Pham finished 5.5/6 for clear first, followed closely by a 3-way tie for > 2nd-4th between Michael Ashcroft, Andrew Leliveld, and U of T student Payam Fakoorziba at 4.5/6. U of T student Daniel > Wang and HHCC member Anna Gavrileva tied for 5th at 4/6.

> In the Under 1300 Section (50 players), Jerry Gerber started off 5/5 before losing to overall winner Oscar Liu (5.5/6) > in the final round. Gerber tied for 2nd with Andrew Sithu and Isabelle Guan. A large number of women and 12 unrated > players played in this section.
> 
> Finally, in the Under 1000 Section (27 players), another large showing of 12 unrated players made up almost 50% of the > field! Perhaps this was a result of increased chess attention thanks to recent successes of chess online and in the > media. Gabriel Saimovici was the overall winner with 5/6, Evan Xi and Dennis Shen split 2nd-3rd at 4.5/6.

> This year, the Team Prize was contested again, consisting of 4 players representing at least 3 different sections. The > total score of each player was added together to form the cumulative team score. 17 teams of 4 entered their names and > after 5 rounds, only 2 teams remained in contention. Tied at 17 points apiece going into Round 6 were the teams > consisting of WIM Yunshan Li, Wenzhi Dai, Cindy Qiao, and Yixiao (Isabelle) Wang alongside the eventually winning team > consisting of IM Nikolay Noritsyn, Leon Perelman, Matthew Shih, and Denys Melnychuk. Perhaps the best team showing in > history, Noritsyn (5.5/6 in Crown), Shih (5/6 in U2200), and Melnychuk (5.5/6 in U1900) finished in first place in their > respective sections. Combined with Perelman’s 4/6 in U2200, the team won a total of 20 out of 24 possible team points!
