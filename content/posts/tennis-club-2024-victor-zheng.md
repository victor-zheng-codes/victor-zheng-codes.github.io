Here is the biography of me for the University of Toronto Tennis Club for 2023-2024. 

--- 

Victor Zheng has served as the UofT Tennis Club’s Head of Courts (21-22), Vice President (22-23), and President (23-present).

Growing up, he was a badminton player. He never took up tennis until the age of 11, when he joined his brother at the UBC’s High-Performance Junior Tennis Training program, then coached by BC Champion Daniel Chu. From then on, he fell in love with tennis as as recreational hobby. He’s competed in a few provincial level events in BC but decided to quit competitive tennis in exchange for recreational tennis in 2016. In Vancouver, Victor plays tennis 4-5 times a week during the summer, and 2-3 times a week during the winter recreationally with his brothers and family. He believes that tennis is for everyone and aspires to introduce tennis to as many people as possible. 

As the President of the Club, he has learnt the ropes of navigating through school life while representing the members of the Club and the interest of tennis enthusiasts at U of T. He has not taken this role lightly and has strived to improve the organization and culture of the Club.

Under his leadership, the Club has grown over 1000% in size (from ~10 to ~140), seen yearly, weekly, indoor and outdoor tennis sessions created, National Bank Open tickets distributed, streaming events created, and various tennis themed events every semester. He has been the sole and consistent driver of the UTTC’s tournaments, practices, and events since joining the Executive in his first year in 2021. He’s climbed the ranks of the student organization and has a lot of other exciting ideas and events still to come. In Fall 2022, he successfully hosted the UofT Tennis Club’s first post-pandemic tennis tournament at the U of T Scarborough Tennis Centre with over 55 players. He also organized the subsequent Fall 2022 Skule Tennis Club vs U of T Tennis Club Match to crown the best tennis club at U of T, which resulted in UTTC taking home the victory. He has also been a leading voice in the cross-university organization of the inaugural Canadian University Tennis Club Championship. 

Outside of tennis, he plays competitive chess for the UofT’s Chess Team and is an Executive on the Hart House Chess Club. He is also part of a high-school hackathon organization, which he serves as a Director. He is in his second-year at UTSG in the computer science specialist program.
