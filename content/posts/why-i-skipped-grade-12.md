Over two years ago, back in 2020, I decided to "skip" grade 12. Here were the reasons that I listed back then (Mar. 2021), unchanged from the moment I wrote them. 

--- 

### The Reasons

> 1. You get an extra year of your life working or learning compared to a regular student. Benefits your wealth, your experiences, etc.
> 2. COVID should be gone by fall, but who knows what will happen next year?
> 3. You boost your morale because it seems like you accomplished something great or made yourself special
> 4. You don't have to go to prom, grad photo-ops with some people you hardly know
> 5. Universities may like your application more since you graduated early. This shows your commitment to learning.
> 6. Pandemic grades are boosted. Therefore, you have a better chance compared to next year students who have to stress more.
> 7. You don't have to spend a year of your life learning stuff that you could have learned a year earlier.
> 8. You have an option of deferring your offer so that you can take a gap year. You could travel, work on other stuff without falling behind.
> 9. You don't have to waste time eating lunch on the floor, waking up early, traveling far for classes.


Another huge part that I talked about in my applications was in #2. In the volatility and fragility of life, and how you don't know what will happen in 1 year

This is especially prevalent during COVID. Do you know what our society will be like in 5 years?

It's was a hard choice at first, but then I asked myself where I wanted to be in one year. At VanTech or in U?

### Looking back now, do I believe I could've or should've stayed at VanTech? 

I really don't think so. Those issues haven't changed in my mind, and that's why I wrote this blog on it. I think over the past 2 years, my belief that it was the right choice has only been strengthened. 

I would point out that learning in high school in Canada is completely different than university. I found highschool to have a ton of people with different life intentions. This meant that getting A's meant trying a bit harder than my other classmates, or thinking about problems in a slightly different way. I could waltz my way into classrooms without studying the material and still make way with memorization and problem solving strategies. In university, this approach doesn't work. You are selected with 90+ averages across all the schools in Canada and so you really don't have an edge over others. Then, add in some super intelligent "math" geniuses from international countries, the competition is completely different. There's nothing that can explain the feeling of taking a university exam - oftentimes, you're left to wonder if you even passed the exam. Whereas in high school, you're wondering about that one question that was "interesting" and you are still 50% confident that you will get 99%. I believe that extra year really changed my perspective on challenges and it was simply a better choice than staying another year and not having that challenge.

There is one thing that I do wish I did consider a bit more. When selecting the University I went into, I chose UofT thanks to a variety of factors, but perhaps not all the correct ones. If I were to give advice to a high-school student thinking about skipping a grade, I'd tell them to consider what their reasons really hard. Ask yourself whether you feel ready for the challenge. Ask yourself what do you want to study. And finally, talk with as many people as possible, even myself. I do think if I had thought harder about it, I would've considered studying engineering instead of computer science, although it's hard to say whether I would've liked it. It's irrelevant today, but perhaps a little more thought would've changed my perspective back then.

I would argue that I also wouldn't have made this choice without a variety of factors. Firstly, I attended public school in East Vancouver, which meant that I had to wake up every morning at 7 am and get home later than 10. I was exhausted and burnt out from the distance. This public school was also not ranked very highly, didn't have AP or IB, and didn't have a lot of extracurricular activities available. The school, did however, have a program called Summit, which I was a part of, that allowed me to take a condensed schedule of Math/Science 8, 9, and 10 in two years. Added on a summer of English, a full course load, and quarterly scheduled courses, I was able to take all of my credits early.  Technically, I got my diploma in December 2020, but I finished the pre-requisites for U of T in June 2021. Also, COVID-19 was really an unknown beast back then and we really didn't know whether things would get any better. You basically were isolated for a full 1.5 years without all of your friends in high school. 

I've been asked by some high-school students whether they should skip grade 12, and I'll always tell them that it depends on their own situation and their own goals in life. 

PS. I also wanted to play and organize more chess and saw that UofT had a great chess environment.
